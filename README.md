### Hi there, I am Nikita 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Data Scientist and lead PGK Digital's Predictive Repair team, which focuses on modeling rail car breakdowns using railway sensor data.
- ⌛ Previously, I worked as a data scientist at Sberbank, the TOP-1 bank in the CIS, where I developed models for optimal credit exposure, default probability assessment, and customer segmentation tailored for corporate business.
- 🕺 I have over five years of experience as a project manager, leading cross-functional teams on projects for major Russian and international companies across various industries, primarily in e-commerce.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the full ML project cycle with my Custom News Aggregator & Sentiment Analyzer. Using MLOps and NLP, I'm honing skills in developing and deploying ML solutions, like named entity recognition and sentiment analysis, while tackling challenges in news relevance accuracy.
